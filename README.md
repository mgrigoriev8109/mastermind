**Mastermind**

A game of mastermind where a code of four colors has to be guessed correctly within 12 turns. In this game the player can guess a code randomly generated by the computer, or the player can come up with a code themselves - to see if the computer can figure it out!

**Demo**

**Features**
Computer that can't be beaten!

**How to use**
Go to https://replit.com/@mgrig92/mastermind#main.rb and type in *ruby main.rb*

**Possible future additions**
-Add conditional so that users can only enter "Yes" or "No" when choosing roles.
-Add conditional so that users can only enter one of the four colors

**Known Bugs**
-Typing in colors other than red, green, blue, or yellow breaks the program.

**Reflections**
A lesson in patience and the proper use of the debugger. In the future I need to be a lot less stubborn, and resort to pry-byebug much earlier, rather than relying on *p variable* to figure out what's wrong with a broken method. 

This project was great practice for getting comfortable with class methods, and I'm excited to read 99 Bottles of OOP, because I do think my code could be organized much better. It's something I want to work on in future projects. That being said, Mastermind was a great experience, and successfully creating a computer that can guess the code in 3 turns was extremely satisfying.
